# phone-ino
A phone sound and display driver for Arduino
## Overview
This program uses a 4x4 numeric keypad, two 4-digit, 7-segment displays, an 8 Î© speaker, and an Arduino Uno to create a simulation of telephone dialing.
## Setup
The displays must be connected to two shift registers connected in series, so that one feeds into the other.
Of two bytes fed subsequently to the latch on the register connected directly to the Arduino, the first controls the character displayed on a segment, and the second indicates which segment to display it on.
(I realise this may be hard to follow, I'll try to create a circuit diagram later.)
